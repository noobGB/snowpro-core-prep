# SnowPro Study App Launcher (Windows) - optional convenience wrapper around Option A of the
# README (docker compose up -d). Starts Docker Desktop if it isn't running, brings the container
# up, waits for the app to respond, then opens it in the default browser.
#
# Usage: run directly (`powershell -File .\Launch-SnowPro.ps1`), or compile it into a
# double-clickable .exe - see the README's "Windows one-click launcher" section for the command.
